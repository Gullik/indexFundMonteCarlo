# indexFundRandomWalker
A simplified simulation of a simplified index fund system


To clear up some misunderstandings I think I have about how a an index fund would
perform, in comparison with an entire total stock market, I'm making this simplified Random Walker simulation of an
index fund tracking the top 10 stocks of a static pool of 100 stocks worth in total 100 coins. The individual stocks are simulated by a random walker characteristics.

The fund starts buying the top 10 stocks, after a cycle it sells the stocks and rebuys the new top 10 stocks. The total fund has an expected growth of 0, and the index fund should have the same.
